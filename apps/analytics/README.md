# Analytics Workspace

Exploratory work now lives under this directory so production services can stay lean.

- `notebooks/` contains active Jupyter notebooks for ad-hoc analysis.
- `depreciated/` retains archived research scripts and historical notebook exports.

Launch your preferred notebook environment from this directory (or open files
directly in VS Code) to inspect data without touching the backend runtime.
