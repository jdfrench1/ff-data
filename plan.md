# Frontend Vue Migration Plan

## Phase 1 - Planning & Tooling (Complete)
- [x] Confirmed API requirements for player search, weekly stats timelines, and roster transitions to feed the Vue UI.
- [x] Selected Vue 3 with Vite, ESLint (flat config), and Vue TSC as the foundation for the new frontend stack.

## Phase 2 - Vue Scaffold (Complete)
- [x] Replaced the React app with a Vue 3 + TypeScript project scaffolded via Vite and refreshed npm scripts.
- [x] Configured linting, formatting, and build tooling with ESLint, vue-tsc, and bundler-aware TypeScript settings.
- [x] Verified the production build pipeline via `npm run build` to ensure parity with previous automation hooks.

## Phase 3 - Player Timeline Feature (Pending)
- [ ] Implement backend endpoints supporting player lookup, historical stats, and team-change events.
- [ ] Build the Vue player selection timeline with highlighted team transitions and responsive data displays.
- [ ] Add automated tests and documentation updates covering the new frontend workflows.
